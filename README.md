# dna-gc-analyzer
A simple Python tool to analyze GC content in DNA sequences from FASTA input. 
ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Applications

The GC content of DNA (the proportion of guanine and cytosine bases) is a key property of genomes.
This project makes it easy to calculate and visualize GC% directly from pasted FASTA sequences.

ðŸ”¬ Why GC Content Matters

Genome characteristics â†’ Organisms have characteristic GC ranges.

Gene prediction â†’ Coding vs. non-coding regions differ in GC%.

PCR & sequencing â†’ High-GC regions can be tricky to sequence.

Evolutionary biology â†’ GC bias may reflect evolutionary adaptation.

ðŸ“Œ Use Cases

Teaching bioinformatics basics with Python.

Quick sequence checks in research workflows.

Visualizing GC% variation across sequences.

Portfolio/blog project combining Python + biology.
